What CouncilPAD Is Not

Not a chatbot

Not a productivity app

Not a gimmick

Not “AI wisdom”

Timeless, not trendy

Avoid:

6. Logo Usage
Logo Characteristics

Flat

Minimal

Works in monochrome

Symbol-first, text-second

Recommended Logo Lockups

Symbol only (for hardware, NFC, favicon)

Symbol + wordmark (for web)

Clear Space Rule

Leave at least the height of the “O” in CouncilPAD around the logo.

7. UI Components
Buttons

Flat

Rounded corners (8–12px)

No drop shadows

Hover = subtle color shift, not motion

Primary CTA:

Gold background

Dark text

Secondary:

Outline only

Wood or charcoal stroke

Cards & Panels

Warm stone background

Subtle border (1px)

No elevation unless necessary

Council Seats

Square or rounded-square frames

Gold glow when active

Dimmed wood tone when inactive

Never flashy

Presence should feel acknowledged, not celebrated.

8. Motion & Interaction
Motion Rules

Slow

Purposeful

No bounce

No playful easing

Think:

Fade

Cross-dissolve

Gentle pulse

9. Voice & Tone (Very Important)
Writing Style

Calm

Clear

Grounded

Non-performative

Confident without hype

Language Rules

Avoid buzzwords

Avoid over-explaining

Avoid moralizing

Avoid “AI will change everything” language

Example Tone

❌ “Harness the power of AI wisdom”
✅ “Invite another perspective into the room”

10. Brand Phrases (Use Sparingly)

“Presence shapes perspective”

“Who is at the table matters”

“Do not collapse complexity prematurely”

“A council, not a chatbot”

“Wisdom becomes present”

11. Hardware + Physical Alignment

CouncilPAD’s digital brand must match the physical object:

Wood textures → warm UI tones

Brass plaques → gold accents

Weight → restrained motion

Ritual → intentional UX

Nothing flashy.
Nothing loud.
Nothing disposable.

12. One-Sentence Brand Summary

CouncilPAD is a modern, flat, human-centered interface for holding multiple perspectives — designed to be touched, considered, and respected.
